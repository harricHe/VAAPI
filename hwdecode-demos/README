Overview
--------

hwdecode-demos consists in simple test programs to address various HW
video decoding APIs: Crystal HD, VA-API, VDPAU and XvBA.


Requirements
------------

* libswscale and libavutil development packages are the minimal
  requirements for all demos called with --getimage or --putimage
  options.

* For Crystal HD demos:
  Crystal HD SDK from GIT, as of 2010/02/15

* For VA-API demos:
  libva >= 0.29.0-sds8 is required for 2D display.
  libva >= 0.30.4-sds3 is required for 3D display.
  That's the API version, not the version of the packages.

* For VDPAU demos:
  VDPAU SDK from any NVIDIA driver should fit as the source code uses
  the bare initial API.

* For XvBA demos:
  XvBA SDK >= 0.73 is required for 2D display.
  XvBA SDK >= 0.74 is required for 3D display.
